# CASSIE: An Artificial Neural Network to Predict Wildfires
Wildfires have always been an extreme problem in California. The damage to human life and property caused by the recent Butte and LA County wildfires highlights the gravity of this problem. It is crucial to have localized and timely wildfire prediction mechanism to protect people and livestock and minimize property damage. In this project, I wanted to explore new methods for wildfire prediction.

I reviewed technical publications and reached out to experts from academia, government, and independent research groups to get an understanding of the state of research. I also searched multiple websites on weather and fire occurrence tracking and collected data.

Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) have been proven to be very adept at making predictions based on recognizing inherent relations in the associated data. For this project, I built a TensorFlow based ANN to leverage its predictive capability. I selected multiple weather parameters, as inputs. The output of the ANN is a probability of fire occurrence. I experimented with different datasets and ANN parameters to test the prediction accuracy.

The experimental results show that an ANN-based method is a viable approach to predict wildfire occurrence. My experiments with limited data sets showed close to 80% prediction accuracy. More experiments with wider datasets, different types of Neural Networks, as well as more variations in the ANN parameters, are required to establish this approach as a mainstream method for fire prediction.

I named my ANN Cassie, short for Cassandra, based on the Greek Mythological character that foretold the future.
